# Deep learning tests

## For Titanic
This is my Deep learning code about the titanic challenge on kaggle. 
I obtained an accuracy of 0.79. 

Just start all of the code. Maybe the "CROSS VALIDATION" part is not so important for you to test. 
Change settings in the training part to obtain a better score than me ! 

## For Japanese YEN
This is my first attempt for an Recurrent Neural Network. 

## For ClassificationME
This is an example of CNN, I had the habit to use Keras for Deep learning, but this time I had to work with Pytorch.
